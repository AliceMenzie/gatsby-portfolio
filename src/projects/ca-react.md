### The Challenge
Libro is a fullstack application aimed at book lovers and enthusiasts.
It is primarily for those who wish to keep a track of their reading activities. 
Libro's backend was made with Rails and its frontend uses React. 

### My Process

This project was a group project and was primarily implemented with the use of paired-programming. 
We had lots of fun using live-share in VSC and using platforms such as Figma and LucidChart in their
live sharing modes at various stages of development.
