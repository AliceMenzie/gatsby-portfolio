### The Challenge

Whilst completing my Diploma of IT at CoderAcademy We were challenged to build a terminal application.
I was inspired by the Age of Empires II API to build an application with that theme because I love the game 
and the community. 

Users can track their performance and access Age of Empires data through the API.
I had a personal challenge of wanting to use an API and was able to achieve this with this project.


### My Process

I used Git and GitHub to track the the development process of this project.
