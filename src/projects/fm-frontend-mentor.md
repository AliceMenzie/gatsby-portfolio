Frontend Menotor is an online platform which offers coding challenges in varying degrees of difficulty. 

### The Challenges

Each challenge provided offers a brief, for example I completed their Coding bootcamp testimonials slider challenged which included the brief:

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like
to practice, feel free to give it a go. The only JavaScript required is for switching the slides.

Your users should be able to:
View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

### My Process

I use different methods of implementation for each challenge some of the the key features include:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Git
- GitHub
- GitHub Pages
