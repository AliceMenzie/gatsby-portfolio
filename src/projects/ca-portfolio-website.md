### The Challenge

My CoderAcadamy Portfolio is my first deployed site. 
It is a simple static site which we were challenged to 
implement a responsive design, a form and a blog section.

### My Process

Through the development of this project and deployment I was able to deploy my first website. I utilised Git and Github to keep track of the development process.
