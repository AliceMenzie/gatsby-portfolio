Local Marketplace is a Two-Sided Marketplace I developed whist studying my Diploma of IT at CoderAcadamy. It allows individuals to purchase and post goods online in their local area. I had a personal challenge of wanting to implement a payment system and was able to achieve this with the use of Stripe.
