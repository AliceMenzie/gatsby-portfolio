### The Challenge
Local Marketplace is a Two-Sided Marketplace I developed whist studying my Diploma of IT at CoderAcadamy.
It allows individuals to purchase and post goods online in their local area.
I had a personal challenge of wanting to implement a payment system and was able to achieve this with the use of Stripe.

### My Process

This Project was implemented with agile methodologies such as the use use of user stories and a kanban workflow.
